*DESCRIPTION*: This Java program is a simple REST API client that connects to the OpenWeatherMap public API to fetch current weather data for a specified city. It uses Javaâ€™s HttpURLConnection to handle HTTP GET requests and the org.json library to parse the returned JSON response. The program extracts key weather information such as the city name, temperature in Celsius, humidity, and a brief description of the weather conditions. The results are displayed in a clear, structured format on the console. This project is a practical example of how to integrate external APIs and handle JSON data in Java applications.
